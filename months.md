# Two Months

Congratulations you have a big idea : )

If you have gotten to the two month stage then you are about to emark on a full scale project.

I could give you all sorts of project management tips at this point, but how you spend your next two months will really depnd on what you are doing.

*Most of the ideas I have never get to the two months stage, mainly because they can reach a compleation point in the two weeks.*
