# Two Weeks

your time is precious, you haven't got two weeks to spend on every idea you have, thats why we've gone through the two second, minute and hour process to filter and proitise your ideas - at this point you should have one or two really good ideas that you are still keen on and dying to turn into something amazing.

From your two hours you should know what you have to do and how long it might take you, I find most ideas can be turned into something that works in two weeks.

> Not many ideas will get to this stage. I only expect to get one project a year to the two week stage and I set aside two weeks during the year to do that project.
