# Two years

Don't worry, we're not suggesting you need to work at your idea for two years solid!

We use the two year timeframe to review what we've done - again depending on what you've achived, you might have to spend time supporting your ideas or even have costs to running things.

Two years is a good amount of time to let your project run - during that time you should get over any inital hump of support and changes as people start to use your stuff - you will know if the costs (both on you and your wallet) are worth the effort.

After two years you can choose what to do, you could shutter your project, or move it on, you might choose to carry on, you might even have more ideas on how you can make things, better just remeber to write them down.

> We shutterd out taskily project after two years, and we learned lots, about building, deploying and supporting software as a service - but in the end we decided the support costs where to high for the returns we where getting - so we decided to close our Software as a Service pages, and keep the code open source so other people can always take it further if they want to.
