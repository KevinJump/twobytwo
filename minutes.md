# Two Minutes

So if you have been jotting ideas down in your two second list, you will have loads of ideas, but still no real idea what you are going to do with them.

The first step in organising your ideas is the two minute process.

When you have a bit more time you should look at your two second list and pick of some ideas to flesh them out a bit.

Just spend two miutes per idea, to jot down a few sentences on how it might work, what are the basic steps you need to take to turn your idea into reality.

Within two minutes you will have a clearer idea of just what then next steps are for turning your idea into reality.

At the end of two minutes you should have :

* some top level steps you will need to take
* and idea of how much effort will be involved
* if you still think the idea is amazing

> At every stage of the process you shouldn't be afraid to thow an idea out. You haven't spent to much time on it at this point, and this process is all about helping you focus the things you want to do
