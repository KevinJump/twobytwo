# Two By Two : Idea Mangement

The two by two process is a simple and clear system that
helps you capture your ideas, proiritise them and understand what is the best course of action.

## Basics

The basics of the two by two system are simple, you start by spending a little amount of time capturing your idea and then increasing a little bit at a time you refine, research and define until you have something you are proud of and willing to share with others.

 6. [Two years](years)

## Filtering

A key part of each phase is filtering; as you spend longer thinking about your ideas you should get a better idea of just how realistic they are.

You shouldn't be afraid to throw ideas away (or at least put them in a no-just-yet list)

## Estimating

As you think about your ideas, also consider how long it might take to achive something - the amount of effort will not only let you plan, but it will also let you guage effort vs return - and that two will help you focus on the ideas that really matter to you.
