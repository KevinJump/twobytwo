# Two Seconds

An idea can come to you in an instant, but it can disapear just as quickly. that's why its important you capture your ideas when they happen.

it doesn't really matter what you use, but you should have something close at hand to note your ideas down.

You shouldn't worry about getting all the details of your idea down, two seconds will be enough to prompt you later on when you have more time to flesh the idea out.

## My two second list

I use Google Keep for this, it is accesible on my phone or computer so i can always fire it up and write my idea down.
